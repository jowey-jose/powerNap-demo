# powerNap-demo
A demo about the power app application. This repo is to set it up on heroku. 
I firstly changed my web files from .html to .php extensions.
I then added composer.json files on my root project.
On the composer.json file I required monolog which on running installed the lock file.
To require monolog I run:
$ composer require monolog/monolog

 I then pushed my changes to git and heroku master and created my application online.
 The following is the link to my application:

 Easy!!..
